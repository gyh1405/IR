In her autobiography ", ", she described an emotionally confusing childhood overseen by a tyrannical, philandering father and a long-suffering mother with whom she strongly identified. Excused from school because of fragile health, Glasgow educated herself by reading from her father's extensive library of classics. As she entered her teens, her reading encompassed the works of the 19th-century historians and social philosophers, including the British naturalist Charles Darwin, whose books made a particularly lasting impression. At age 17, Glasgow refused a debut into society and set to work on her first novel which she later destroyed. Her second novel, ", ", published anonymously in 1897, was embraced by advocates of the new realism in ", ", as were the two novels that followed, ", " (1900) and ", " (1906). In these early works, set in ", " and populated by uprooted southerners, Glasgow explored the problems of the struggling woman artist.", "With ", " (1900), about the ", ", Glasgow embarked on a series of books about Virginia, which included ", " (1902), ", " (1904), ", " (1913), ", " (1925), ", " (1935), and ", " (1941), for which she received the Pulitzer Prize. These works explore the social and political history of Virginia from 1850 and represent a break with the sentimental tradition of Southern fiction, what Glasgow called \"evasive idealism.\" She won genuine critical success with ", ", a grimly tragic tale set in rural Virginia, which she felt would make or break her reputation as a writer. Many consider it her best work.", "In three comedies of manners, ", " (1926), ", " (1929), and ", " (1932), Glasgow put forth her own ambivalent feelings about the decline of Southern aristocracy in the face of encroaching industrialization. Called an \"ironic tragedian\" by Henry Seidel Canby, Glasgow was a masterful satirist, particularly in her portrayal of Southern women and their relations to Southern men. \"The realism which engages this author,\" writes ", " , \"is the penetration of shams, a perpetual rebellion against hypocrisy.\"", "Glasgow never married, although as a young woman she had an intense love affair with a married man, \"Gerald B,\" who died in 1905. She also had an enduring relationship with Henry Watkins Anderson, a successful Richmond lawyer and unsuccessful Republican candidate for governor in 1921, to whom she was once engaged. (Glasgow collaborated with Anderson on the 1919 political novel ", ", for which he also served as a model for the story's hero.)", "After the suicide of her brother in 1909 and the death of her beloved sister ", " in 1911, Ellen exiled herself in ", " for a period but returned to Richmond in 1916. Except for travel abroad and summer respites in Massachusetts or Maine, she lived and worked most of her life in a century-old Greek Revival house in the heart of Richmond. \"We live,\" she once said, \"where we are born.\" For many years, she shared her home with her secretary, nurse, and housekeeper, ", " , and her adored dogs. (Glasgow loved animals and helped found the Richmond Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.) One of her greatest burdens was her deafness, which came on in adolescence and worsened with age, isolating her and causing bouts of depression. Although she described her life as a \"long tragedy,\" compensated only by her literary pursuits, friends recalled her as charming, with a ready smile and a gift for witty conversation.", "Often compared to ", " and ", " , Glasgow was generally recognized during her time as one of America's foremost novelists. In 1932, she was elected to the National Institute of Arts and Letters and, in 1940, received the Howells Medal from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 1941, she was given the Southern Authors Award and, in 1942, the Pulitzer Prize for fiction for ", ".", "Toward the end of her career, Glasgow became disillusioned with modern urban life and grew increasingly nostalgic for the lost agrarian society. Notes Marcelle Thiebaux in ", " \"As she grew older she found it difficult to cast aside the values she had once lightheartedly satirized. She saw the modern world as 'distraught, chaotic, grotesque, … an age of cruelty without more indignation, of catastrophe without courage.'\" In December 1939, after completing the first draft of ", ", Glasgow suffered a severe ", ". Confined to bed for months afterward, she finished the novel with the help of her friend and fellow novelist ", ". Through sheer determination, she continued to write, publishing her only nonfiction, ", " (a collection of critical essays), two years before her death in 1945.

    {"title": " Ellen Glasgow", "content": ["Ellen Glasgow was born on April 22, 1873, in Richmond, Va. Her father was a Scotch-Irish Presbyterian who \"never committed a pleasure.\" His wife was a woman of \"laughing spirit\" whom he neither understood nor appreciated. Ellen's childhood was marred by her parents' misalliance (a subject her fiction frequently reflected), but her youth was secure and privileged, and she acquired a good education under private tutors.", "Political economy was Glasgow's special interest. Before she was 20 ", "'s book ", " converted her to Fabian socialism, though she remained hostile to the idea of revolution. Cruelty, greed, and intolerance were the real adversaries of mankind, she believed. Her novels led Southern fiction away from the accepted lies that the enemy was the North, the nouveau riche, or black people; they showed that the foe was not without but within.", "Shortly after her mother's death in 1893, Glasgow finished her first novel, ", " which was published anonymously in 1897. Perhaps the young woman approached writing with such professional dedication because an affliction, deafness, seemed to make \"normal\" life impossible. \"At twenty-two,\" she later wrote, \"I told myself that marriage was not for me.\"", "Love was another matter, however. When Glasgow returned from a trip abroad in 1899, she met a man in ", ", whom she calls Gerald B——in her autobiography. She almost forgot her deafness and made the most of her personal gifts: beauty, gaiety, and wit. Gerald B——was married, but the affair evidently brought the young writer a new sense of her power. The novels of this period, ", " (1900), ", " (1902), and ", " (1904), reflect this new-found power.", "Gerald B——died in 1905. Glasgow's next books may reflect that loss, but by 1909, when ", " appeared, she was clearly in control of her art. The year her father died, 1916, saw the publication of ", " which studied the character of Southern women. In 1917 she became engaged to Henry W. Anderson, but the engagement was finally broken.", " (1924), ", " (1926), and ", " (1932) are three of Glasgow's best novels. ", " (1941), her last novel, received the Pulitzer Prize.

Hubbell, ", " (1954); and ", ", ", " (1964), reprinted in his ", " (1965). Miss Glasgow's relation to Southern literary traditions is discussed by C. Hugh Holman in R. C.
